# Install & Composer

### Install via [rupal-composer](https://github.com/drupal-composer)/[**drupal-project**](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)

### What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`, instead of the one provided by Drupal \(`web/vendor/autoload.php`\).
* Modules \(packages of type `drupal-module`\) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme \(packages of type `drupal-theme`\) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles \(packages of type `drupal-profile`\) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates `web/sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.
* Creates environment variables based on your .env file. See [.env.example](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/blob/8.x/.env.example).
